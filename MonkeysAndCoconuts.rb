#Monkeys And Coconuts
#Fergus Farrell - 23/06/2017

#'n' number of men have washed up on the shore of a deserted island.
#They gather all the coconuts on the island and stack them in the middle.
#The men do not trust each other so in the night, 1 by 1, each man:
#   Splits the coconut pile into n equal piles, there is always 1 coconut left over (which he gives to the monkey)
#   The man then hides 1 pile and puts remaining piles together to reform the large pile

#Question: How many coconuts did the men start with?
